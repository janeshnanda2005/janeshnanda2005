The cat command in Linux is a versatile tool used for displaying, combining, and manipulating text files. It can be used to view file contents, concatenate files, and create new files. Common options include -n for numbering lines, -s for squeezing multiple blank lines into one, and -v for showing non-printing characters. Additionally, cat can be used with redirection operators like > to write output to a file and >> to append to an existing file.
